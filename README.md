# Basic Search

In the <code>components/App.js</code>, an array with strings is given.

You need to implement an input on which when user types, you show the strings from the array
which includes that character. 

Ex:- String "Mongoose" includes "oo" so that string will be shown.
Also in this particular scenario, if user types "n" it should show "Newton School" despite the "n" being lowercased here.
Ignore case in search.

Give the input the id="search-input". And show the individual search results inside an unordered list.

Note:- When user types and then removes the typed text from input, the search should not show any other results.
